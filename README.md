# shERIFF

Ever run something in a script you didn't want to run?

Wouldn't you rather someone check to make sure that you're not making a mistake that could screw up your work?

Enter shERIFF, the bash wrapper that checks to make sure you actually meant to write/run each line in your bash script before executing it.

(under active development, looking for interested developers to help maintain this codebase)
